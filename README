--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the first BETA release of a Perl interface to:

  * the X11 C library
  * the X11 Toolkit
  * the OSF Motif widget set (version 1.2.4)

To build the release:

  1. Edit config.pm to customize the compilation options to your
     site.  The default configuration is for Solaris 2.5 with
     CDE.  The Athena and X Pixmap modules are not yet available.

     If you are on a system that is not already defined in the
     config.pm, please send me the necessary changes so it is
     supported in a future release.  Thanks!

  2. Run "perl Makefile.PL".  Make sure that you are running perl
     version 5.004 or higher.

  3. Run "make"

If everything builds properly, you will have a new "./blib" directory
with all the modules installed into it.  Please do not install this into
your perl site directory unless you are SURE you want to deal with beta
software.  The software probably has unknown bugs and may change in
incompatible ways.

  4. If you really want to use beta software, install the X11
     modules into your site directory by running "make install"

You can test the modules by running some of the scripts in the
test directory.  In particular, try "select-file.pl" because that
uses quite a few different Motif widgets in a real-world example.
If you have a minimal Perl installation, try "test.pl" for a tiny
demo.  There aren't any regression style tests, so don't try to
run a "make test".

Please send bug reports to <fox@vulpes.com>.  Include a typescript
session of the bug and the output of "perl -V".  If you run into
compilation errors, please send your config.pm along with the complete
output of make.

Documentation in "./doc" is far from complete, but it should enable
an experienced Motif programmer to start using the module.

Two areas where I could use additional help are writing widget
demonstrations and writing documentation.  I'm spending most of my
time doing this now; the code itself is fairly stable.

Any questions or comments?  Please send them to <fox@vulpes.com>.
